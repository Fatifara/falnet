		<h3>Taraba Poverty Reduction/Growth Strategy Ministry of Cooperative & Poverty Alleviationâ€™s Mandate </h3>
		<p class="desc">The mandate of the Ministry of Cooperative & Poverty Alleviation is the creation of forums that will alleviate poverty, prioritize equitable distribution of wealth, reduce income inequality and enhance the economic growth for sustainable development.
		Cooperative Societies are a major source of financial assistance to the poor. Their activities are controlled by their members who actively participate in the decision-making process of the society. 
		The government of Nigeria has over the years embarked on several programmes aimed at alleviating the poverty situation of her citizenry.  In as much as these programmes were mostly developmental initiatives, they were designed to take care of employment (generate employment), improve agricultural output and income, and reduce the tide of rural-urban migration. Some of these programmes recorded some level of successes; most of them were not sustained. They failed as a result of diversion from the original focus which is centering on the Cooperative Societies.
		One of the most reliable means of tackling poverty and reducing unemployment is through the empowerment and strengthening of the cooperative societies through the relevant agency. This will smoothly enhance the access to empowerment interventions and improve economic growth.
		The plan for prosperity must address a starting paradox, and for Taraba state, it is discovered that the most viable channel to achieve that is through the engagement of the Multi-purpose Cooperative Societies through the Ministry of Cooperative & Poverty Alleviation.</p>

		<h3 style="text-align: left;">Who we are?</h3>
		<p class="slogan" style="text-align: left;">STATEMENT OF WORK </p>
		<p class="desc">As a company, we develop an internet website with an attached portal for our clients. We create a clean, organized, and professional looking website, and develop a consistent theme with the use of the organization logo, colors, heading and footers, and buttons. And for the portal, the validation button will link to the securitization page for new all existing MPCS while the login page will lead to all information about what is required of MPCS in the sites database.
		We will be stationed in all the LGAs as and when due, to collate, validate, securitize and re-issue new MPCS Certificates to ALL existing MPCS in Taraba state thus rendering the previously acquired MPCS Certificates non-acceptable for any state-wide intervention access. The Re-Issued Securitized Certificates will serve as the only Legal Tender as far as Multi-purpose Cooperative Societies in Taraba State is concerned. The Ministry of Cooperative & Poverty Alleviation reserves the right to evaluate, monitor and enforce the usage and/or otherwise of its property to be used for accessing benefits from government and other affiliate organizations.
